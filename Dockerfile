# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM keeps the build stage on the runner's native arch and
# lets Go cross-compile to $TARGETARCH instead of emulating the whole toolchain
# under QEMU. For a pure-Go binary this is the same output at a fraction of the
# build time, so multi-arch costs us almost nothing here.
